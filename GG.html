     <p[>When I Look At Myself, I Am So Beautiful I Scream With Joy!</p>
        <p>  All women deserve to be appreciated, respected, and admired. When a woman improves her appearance, an amazing thing happens. People begin to pay attention to her, listen to her, seek her company, ask her opinion. She becomes more confident, and this makes her look even better! As her confidence grows, so does the respect she receives – at work, at home, everywhere. As her insecurity falls away, she becomes more daring, self-assured, courageous; she finds she can do anything. Her life improves in every way.

In Spanish we have a handy word, arreglarse. It means to make yourself look good – to do your hair and nails, put on makeup, put on nice clothes and shoes. It doesn't matter about your weight, your age, your complexion… However you are, you can always arreglarte! Aside from your vestuario (wardrobe and accessories) the hair, nails, and makeup are the Three Pillars of Beauty.</p>
